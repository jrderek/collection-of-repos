    "# CNN Exercise - Deep Learning for Computer Vision\n",
    "__Introduction:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks have tremendous potential to learn complex non-linear functions, patterns, and representations. This includes real-world applications like image categorization and classification and the very popular concept of image artistic style transfer. Computer vision is all about the art and science of making machines understand high-level useful patterns and representations from images and videos so that it would be able to make intelligent decisions similar to what a human would do upon observing its surroundings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks or CNNs are extensively used for automated feature extraction in images.  In fact, CNNs are similar to the general deep neural networks, but with explicit assumption of input being a data set where which the location of a feature is relevant can be attempted via CNNs  like image, but not limited to then. Others examples are:\n",
    "- ***Time series***: your data is well ordered. A time series problem would make a 1–d convolution the right choice.\n",
    "- ***Weather***: Build a map of current weather conditions (location-based values, but not actual images). Add another dimension to it for the previous weather maps (in order) and you have a 4–d convolution problem to predict the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explore convolutional neural networks through the task of image classification using publicly dataset  CIFAR-10. We will utilize our understanding of CNNs to then take on the task of style transfer and understand how neural networks can be used to understand high-level features. Through this notebook, we cover the following topics:\n",
    "- Image classification use CNNs from scratch\n",
    "- Transfer learning: image classification using pretrained models\n",
    "- Neural style transfer using CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth understanding of CNNs applied for visual recognition take look on the [Stanford course material](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks). Let us see a little brief overview of its key concepts:\n",
    "- ***A CNN is made up of Layers***: Every Layer has a simple API: It transforms an input 3D volume to an output 3D volume with some differentiable function that may or may not have parameters. the main layers are:\n",
    "    - ***Convolutional Layer***: Is a set of slides or convolves learnable filters, also known as kernels or convolution matrix, to help capture spatial features. These cover the width, height and the full depth (color range) of the image. During the forward pass, we slide the filter across the width and the height of the image while computing the dot product between the filter attributes and the input at any position. The output is a two-dimensional activation map from each filter, which are then stacked to get the final output.\n",
    "    - ***Pooling Layer***: These are basically down-sampling layers used to reduce spatial size and number of parameters by apply functions such as max, average, L2-norm, and so on. These layers also help in controlling overfitting.  These layers are insert in between conv layers or in the end of a sequence of them.\n",
    "    - ***Fully Connected Layer***: This layer helps perform the tasks of classification. It is similar to fully connected layers in general neural networks. These have full connections to all neurons in the previous layer and can followed by a Dropout to help to reduce overfit.<p>\n",
    "- ***Parameter Sharing***: Conv layers use same set of weights across the filters thus reducing the overall number of parameters required.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs have gone through tremendous research and advancements have led to more complex and power architectures, like VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception V3, and many models that are more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our studies:\n",

    "### Data Augmentation\n",
    "Keras provides the [ImageDataGenerator](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) class that defines the configuration for image data preparation and augmentation. This includes capabilities such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample-wise standardization. \n",
    "- Feature-wise standardization.\n",
    "- ZCA whitening.\n",

    "- Save augmented images to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than performing the operations on your entire image dataset in memory, the API is designed to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. The data will be looped over (in batches). This reduces your memory overhead, but adds some additional time cost during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have created and configured your ImageDataGenerator, you must fit it on your data. This will calculate any statistics required to actually perform the transforms to your image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to standardize pixel values across the entire dataset. This is called feature standardization and mirrors the type of standardization often performed for each column in a tabular dataset. You can perform feature standardization by setting the ***featurewise_center*** and ***featurewise_std_normalization*** parameters as ***True***.

Less redundancy in the image is intended to better highlight the structures and features in the image to the learning algorithm.

So, let us go to see how we can get better results by make improvements on a pre-trained more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN with Pre-Trained Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Since obtaining large labeled datasets and training highly complex and deep neural networks is a time consuming task  In practice, we utilize a concept, what is formally termed as transfer learning. This concept of transfer learning helps us leverage existing models for our tasks. The core idea is to leverage the learning, which the model learned from being trained over a large dataset and then transfer this learning by re-using the same model to extract feature representations from new images.  There are many  models have deep and complex architectures that have been fine-tuned and trained over diverse, large datasets. Hence, these models have been proven to have amazing performance on complex object recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several strategies of performing transfer learning, the mains are:\n",
    "- ***Pre-trained model as feature extractor***: Since the main objective of convolutions and pooling layers are extract features from the data-set, we ca use the pre-trained model is used to extract features for our dataset. We build a fully connected classifier on top of these features. In this case we only need to train the fully connected classifier, which does not take much time.\n",
    "- ***Fine-tuning pre-trained models***: It is possible to fine-tune an existing pre-trained model by fixing some of the layers and allowing others to learn/update weights apart from the fully connected layers. Usually it is observed that initial layers capture generic features while the deeper ones become more specific in terms of feature extraction. Thus, depending upon the requirements, we fix certain layers and fine-tune the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, when we have a small training set and our problem is similar to the task for which the pre-trained models were trained, we can use transfer learning. If we have enough data, we can try and tweak the convolutional layers so that they learn more robust features relevant to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will utilize a pre-trained conv-network as a fine-tuning pre-trained models and build fully connected layer based classifier on top of it and train the model to help us build a classifier on CIFAR10 dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For do this, we will use the VGG-19 model from the Visual Geometry Group of the Oxford University is one state-of-the-art convolutional neural network. This has been shown to perform extremely well on various benchmarks and competitions. VGG19 is a 19-layer conv-net trained on ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is visual database of hand-annotated images amounting to 10 million spanning across 9,000+ categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we would be using VGG-19 for fine-tuning, we do not need the top (or fully connected) layers of this model. keras makes this as simple as setting the include_top parameter to False.

    "Our model achieved good accuracy in the training data, but it shows some overfit, since it lose too much accuracy in the validation and test. Therefore, we need work on tuning parameter, change some VGG layer to learnable, change the fully connected layer. and/or increase the number of epochs.\n",

    "The task of fine-tuning a network is to tweak the parameters of an already trained network so that it adapts to the new task at hand. In general, the initial layers learn very general features and as we go higher up the network, the layers tend to learn patterns more specific to the task it is being trained on. Thus, for fine-tuning, we want to keep the initial layers intact and retrain the later layers for our task.\n",

The main advantage is instead of spending time reinventing the wheel, with a few lines of code, we were able to leverage state of the art neural network for our classification task. In the other hand, you have more control on the scratch approach, and in the case of the transfer you continue need work on tuning."
